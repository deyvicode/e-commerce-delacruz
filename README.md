## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

* `yarn start` Runs the app in the development mode.\
*Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.*


* `yarn test` Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
*See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.*

* `yarn build` Builds the app for production to the **build** folder.\
*It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.*

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

* `yarn eject` This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.\
*If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can **eject** at any time.*
